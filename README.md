# Logic
A LITTLE MATHEMATIQUE ALGORITHM 

# Problem:
Implement a function that can solve the following problem:
Given a number A, find the smallest number which has only 1s and 0s as its digits which are divisible by the number A.
For example:
If the given number A is 4, the smallest number with 1s and 0s which is divisible by 4 is 100.
If the given number A is 3, the answer would be 111.
-	If you cannot figure the answer out on your own, you may use online resources or a book or whatever method you find necessary to find the solution, but we would like to know what reference you used so that we can assess it as part of your work;
-	 The work can be in any programming language you choose;
-	When you send your solution, include a description and pseudocode of how you approached the problem and a summary of how the program finds an answer in your own words.

#Waiting for your own way for solving that problem.
